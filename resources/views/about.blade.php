                Apostolic Ministers Conference is a HOLYGHOST anchored Assembly that was birthed in 2015 to address the following issues. Borne out of a vision received by God's Servant,<strong> Rev. Gabriel Amedu </strong>in 2014,<br>

                 the Conference focuses on bringing Ministers together across non-denominational lines so as to:
                 Set them ablaze for greater exploits.

                </h3>

The Conference seeks to re-ignite Apostolicism, Charismaticism, Pentecostalism and multiply the anointing of God in Men, like Samson's 300 foxes of fire. The Conference provides an atmosphere of fellowship with the Holy Spirit so as to impregnate Gospel Ministers with new seed vision, a burden for end time harvest and to weaponise Gospel Soldiers with divine armour as God's armour bearers. It is a conference with a template to strengthen the spiritual life of men of God and reactivate in them the renewed consciousness and conscience for the neglected truth of the Bible.

                &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;Today, holiness inspired life style and spiritual fervency among servants of God have faded, while the pursuits of canal adornment and canal values have taken the place of godly zeal. Rather than follow biblical principles and templates set by Jesus Christ and faithfully observed by the apostles, most ministers now embrace worldly wisdom, strategies and shenanigans thus bringing strange fire to the temple of the Almighty.The result is obvious; a lifestyle that is anything but Christ-like and devoid of power; churches that are filled with everything except the presence of the Almighty; and altars that have been hijacked by false prophets and magicians who use God's name to lead many to hell instead of to repentance.
                Consequent upon the above, the conference was born to reverse the works of the devil in the church and society at large. John 3:8.
